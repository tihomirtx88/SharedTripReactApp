# Reflection 
   ### This was my second project on React built during my third module at JS Web in software university.Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to to create trips and join other trips,also the owner on some of the trips can edit informacion about the trip or delete trip.One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication between React and server side. At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project for server side are Node.js, Mongoose, express, bcrypt, JWT and  for front-end - React, React-Router-Dom, VanillaJS, HTML, CSS, Formik, Reactjs-Popup and more.
